# APCS-Final-Project

This was what I made for my final project in my High School AP Computer Science class.

## How to Play

Run the jar file by double clicking on it.

## Having Issues?

This game was tested and works on Windows 10 Pro with a openGL compatible Nvidia GPU but should work on any version of Windows 10 with any openGL compatible GPU.

### Note:

The jar file needs to stay in the same directory with the resources file or the game will not work.

## Goals for the Project

Here are a list of goals that I had in mind for this project.

### Accomplished Goals:

Make a top down shooter game
Make bots to play against
Make a map to play on
Make random spawns

### Failed Goals:

Multiplayer
Audio
