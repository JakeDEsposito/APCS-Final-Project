# APCS-Final-Project

This was what I made for my final project in my High School AP Computer Science class.

## How to Play

Run the jar file by double clicking on it.

## Having Issues?

This game was tested and works on Windows 10 Pro with a openGL compatible Nvidia GPU but should work on any version of Windows 10 with any openGL compatible GPU.

### Note:

The jar file needs to stay in the same directory with the resources file or the game will not work.

## Goals for the Project

Here are a list of goals that I had in mind for this project.

### Accomplished Goals:

- Make a top down shooter game
- Make bots to play against
- Make a map to play on
- Make random spawns

### Uncompleted Goals:

- Multiplayer
- Audio

### Final Words

I had a lot of fun with this project and I was able to learn a lot about what goes into making a game and game engine. Thank you to [Game With Gabe](https://www.youtube.com/c/GamesWithGabe) for making awesome YouTube tutorials. I really wouldn't have been able to accomplish what I did without him.
